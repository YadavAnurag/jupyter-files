Matplotlib Architecture---
1. Scripting Layer (pyplot)
2. Artist Layer (Artist)
3. Backend Layer (FigureCanvas, Renderer, Evnet)

Backend Layer
	Has three built-in abstart interface classes:
		1. FigureCanvas: matplotlib.backend_bases.FigureCanvas
			Encompasses the area onto which the figure is drawn
		2. Renderer: matplotlib.backend_bases.Renderer
			Knows how to draw on the FigureCanvas
		3. Event: matplotlib.backend_bases.Event
			Handles user inputs such as keyboard strokes and mouse clicks

Artist Layer
	1. 	Comprised of one main objec- Artist
		Knows how to use the Renderer to draw on the canvas
	
	2. Title, lines, tick labels, and images, all correspond to individual Artist instances.

	3. Two types of Artist objects:
		1. Primitive: Line2D, Rectangle, Circle and Text.
		2. Composite: Axis, Tick, Axex and Figure.

	4. Each composite artist may contain other composite artists as well as primitive artists.
	Eg. Figure-Line2D,Axix
